## Problems from Chapter 2

### 1. In what ways does self-organization change the day-to-day life of a developer?

Self-organization changes the daily life of a developer in the following ways:

1. **Task Selection and Ownership**: Developers in a self-organized Agile team have the autonomy to choose tasks that align with their interests and skills, enhancing job satisfaction and skill development.
2. **Collaborative Environment**: Encourages teamwork, immediate issue resolution, and continuous learning.
3. **Empowerment and Decision-Making**: Developers actively contribute to problem-solving, increasing engagement and accountability.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Retrospectives help teams identify and resolve recurring issues.
5. **Flexible Team Dynamics**: Developers can take on diverse roles and learn new skills.
6. **Reduced Managerial Oversight**: Encourages accountability and a more empowered team structure.

### 3. Why would frequent delivery of working software make a developer uncomfortable?

Frequent delivery can be unsettling due to:
- A shift in expectations from long development cycles to rapid iteration.
- The need for frequent stakeholder feedback and adjustments.
- The pressure to deliver production-ready code quickly, which can be challenging for perfectionists.

### 6. Instead of offering solutions to the team, what should an Agile manager do?

- **Ask Questions**: Encourage self-organization by prompting critical thinking.
- **Redirect Questions to the Team**: Reinforce team authority by directing external inquiries to them.
- **Stay Silent in Meetings**: Allow the team to drive discussions and decisions independently.

### 9. How can an Agile manager demonstrate trust in a team?

1. Letting the team self-organize without micromanagement.
2. Asking guiding questions instead of providing direct solutions.
3. Supporting team problem-solving without immediate intervention.
4. Being open to new ideas and changes suggested by the team.
5. Creating a safe space for experimentation.
6. Avoiding a command-and-control approach to foster collaboration.

### 13. Why might an executive want to change the priorities for an Agile team immediately?

- Urgent customer feedback requiring immediate action.
- A high-value business opportunity demanding a specific feature.
- Competitive pressures necessitating rapid adjustments.

Frequent priority changes can disrupt workflows, so executives should ensure proper assessment before making adjustments.

### 15. What are examples of metrics that drive the wrong behavior, and why? [give at least 3]

1. **Actual Time Taken vs. Estimated Time**: Overemphasis on accuracy can lead to excessive planning rather than productive work.
2. **Comparing Velocity Between Teams**: Creates unhealthy competition and ignores differences in team contexts.
3. **Number of Stories with Acceptance Criteria**: Shifts focus from collaboration to merely meeting checklist requirements.

### 19. Why would someone choose to leave an organization rather than move to an Agile environment?

1. **Discomfort with Accountability and Transparency**.
2. **Struggles with Independence**.
3. **Resistance to Teamwork and Change**.
4. **Cultural Resistance**.
5. **Preference for Traditional Management Styles**.

### 20. What should be done when an aspect of the Agile transformation is not working?

1. **Inspect and Adapt**: Continuously evaluate and adjust the transformation approach.
2. **Executive Commitment**: Ensure leadership remains dedicated to Agile principles.
3. **Address Cultural Resistance**: Encourage and reward adaptability.
4. **Support Self-Organizing Teams**: Empower teams to resolve challenges independently.
5. **Avoid Command and Control Management**: Shift managers toward facilitation rather than direct oversight.
6. **Focus on Sustainability**: Prevent burnout by maintaining a sustainable work pace.

## Problems from Chapter 3

### 1. What are the key themes for Extreme Programming (XP)?

- Frequent releases and short development cycles.
- Regular builds and integration tests.
- High code quality and preventing breakages.
- Simple, maintainable code.
- Rapid feedback through Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### 3. What five activities need to be performed in an FDD project?

1. **Create the model**: Define project scope and context through customer walkthroughs.
2. **Develop the feature list**: Identify key user-focused features.
3. **Plan by feature**: Order and assign features to developers.
4. **Design by feature**: Develop sequence diagrams and refine the model.
5. **Build by feature**: Write, test, review, and integrate code incrementally.

### 4. What four requirement categories are used for DSDM?

- **Must have**: Essential features for system functionality.
- **Should have**: Important but non-essential features.
- **Could have**: Nice-to-have features that add value.
- **Wonâ€™t have**: Low-priority features that can be deferred.

### 5. What are the seven principles of Lean software development?

1. **Eliminate waste**.
2. **Amplify learning**.
3. **Decide as late as possible**.
4. **Deliver as fast as possible**.
5. **Empower the team**.
6. **Build integrity in**.
7. **See the whole**.

### 7. What are the four key principles of Kanban?

1. **Foster leadership at all levels**.
2. **Start with what you know**.
3. **Focus on incremental and evolutionary change**.
4. **Respect current methodologies and roles**.

### 8. Why was "Crystal" used to name the Crystal Family?

The Crystal methodology was named for its resemblance to crystals, where no two are alike in shape, color, or hardness. This reflects the unique needs of different projects. The color continuum (e.g., Clear Quartz for small projects, Sapphire for large ones) symbolizes varying complexity levels.
